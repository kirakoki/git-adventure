    <h1>Git Adventure</h1>    
         <h4>What is Git and why is it so important?<h4>
            <p>Git is the most commonly used version control system.<p>Git tracks the changes you make to files, so you have a record of what has been done, and you can revert to specific versions should you ever need to.
            <p>Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source.</p>
        <h4>What’s a branch and why do we create them?</h4> 
            <p>A branch is like a parallel world where you can create commit without introducing bugs into production code.</p>  <p>You can always fix the bugs before merging your branch into the production code.</p>
        <h4>What’s the working tree?</h4>
            <p>Your working tree is what is actually in the files that you are currently working on.</p><p>HEAD is a pointer to the branch or commit that you last checked out, and which will be the parent of a new commit if you make it.</p>
            <p>... git add will add or update files from the working tree into your index</p>   
        <h4>What’s the staging area?</h4>
            <p>The working area is where files that are not handled by git.</p><p>hese files are also referred to as "untracked files.</p><p>taging area is files that are going to be a part of the next commit, which lets git know what changes in the file are going to occur for the next commit.</p>
